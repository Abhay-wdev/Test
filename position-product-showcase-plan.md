# Plan to Position Product Showcase Next to Hero Section

## 1. Identified Cause
The gap observed below the hero section in the application was caused by the Tailwind CSS utility class `py-12` applied to the `<section>` element that wraps the `ProductShowcase` component. This was found in the file [`src/pages/Index.tsx`](src/pages/Index.tsx) on line 15. The `py-12` class adds `3rem` of padding to both the top and bottom of the section.

## 2. User Goal
The user wants the "Premium Quality Spices" section (which is part of the `ProductShowcase` component) to appear directly beneath the hero section, with no vertical gap.

## 3. Confirmed Solution
To achieve the desired layout, the top padding needs to be removed from the container section of the `ProductShowcase` component. This will be done by modifying its `className` attribute.

The current class is: `className="py-12 bg-white"`

The class will be changed to: `className="pt-0 pb-12 bg-white"`

This change specifically sets `padding-top: 0px;` while retaining `padding-bottom: 3rem;` and the background color.

## 4. Implementation Steps
1.  The user has approved this plan.
2.  This plan has been saved to `position-product-showcase-plan.md`.
3.  Switch to "Code" mode.
4.  Apply the class modification to the `<section>` element on line 15 of the file [`src/pages/Index.tsx`](src/pages/Index.tsx).
    *   **Search:** `className="py-12 bg-white"`
    *   **Replace:** `className="pt-0 pb-12 bg-white"`
5.  The "Product Showcase" section should now be positioned directly below the Hero section.
